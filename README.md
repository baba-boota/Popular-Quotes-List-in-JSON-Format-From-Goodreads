## A list of most liked quotes

[`quotes.json`](https://github.com/baba-boota/Popular-Quotes-List-in-JSON-Format-From-Goodreads/blob/main/quotes.json) is a list of all quotes as scraped from [Goodreads Popular Quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes) pages.

You can run the scraper to get an updated list of quotes but I strongly suggest not to do it because the list probably remains unchanged except the last few pages:
- git clone this repo
- `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `$ python main.py`
